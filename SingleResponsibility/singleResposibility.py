"""We have a User class which is responsible for both the user properties and user 
database management. If the application changes in a way that it affect database 
management functions. The classes that make use of User properties will have to be
 touched and recompiled to compensate for the new changes. Itâ€™s like a domino effect,
 touch one card it affects all other cards in line."""
